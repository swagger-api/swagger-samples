# swagger-samples

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and 
computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or 
through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the 
remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level 
programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.
